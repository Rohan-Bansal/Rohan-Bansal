### Hey! I'm Rohan, welcome to my Github Profile. ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Rohan Bansal, a hacker ðŸ’» and maker :hammer: from Mountain View, California. I love to code and contribute to open-source! You can probably find me on my laptop, wiring something, playing guitar :guitar:, or gaming :video_game: !

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- [Ricochet](https://github.com/Rohan-Bansal/Ricochet): My custom physics and UI engine to speed up the game dev workflow. 
- *CanvasNative*: A cross-platform desktop app for the Canvas LMS interface built with Dart, embedded with Go, and with an optimized, reorganized, and streamlined interface!
- [ThetaHacks](https://thetahacks.tech): An epic high-school hackathon I'm coordinating that's coming to the Bay Area in 2021, aimed at bringing the world of tech to prospective engineers!

:game_die: A few tools and frameworks I've been working with recently:

- Flutter
- OpenGL
- Heaps.io
- FireBase
