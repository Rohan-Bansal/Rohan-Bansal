## Hey, I'm Rohan! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a hacker ðŸ’» and maker :hammer: from Mountain View, California. 


I love to code and contribute to open-source! You can probably find me on my laptop , wiring something, playing guitar :guitar:, or gaming :video_game: !

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- [Ricochet](https://github.com/Rohan-Bansal/Ricochet): My custom physics and UI engine to speed up the game dev workflow. 
- CanvasNative: A cross-platform desktop app for the Canvas LMS interface built with Dart, embedded with Go, and with an optimized, reorganized, and streamlined interface!
- [ThetaHacks](https://thetahacks.tech): An epic high-school hackathon I'm coordinating that's coming to the Bay Area in 2021, aimed at bringing the world of tech to prospective engineers!

Check out my [website](https://rbansal.dev) for more info, and if you want to connect :)
