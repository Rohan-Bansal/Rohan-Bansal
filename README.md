## Hey, I'm Rohan! ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a programmer from Mountain View, California. 


You can probably find me messing with electronics ðŸ”Œ, playing guitar ðŸŽ¸, developing a game ðŸŽ® or working on some other cool software!

**Want to check out the cool stuff I'm working on? Go enter this into your terminal:**
```bash
ssh me.rbansal.dev
```
